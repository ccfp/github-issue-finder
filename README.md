## Overview

Idea for a long(ish)-term collaborative project for CCFP members to contribute to. I would like to leverage a functional programming approach as much as possible, while staying reasonably within the bounds of everyone's wheelhouse. It could also be an opportunity to "level up" and learn some emerging tech (e.g., since we'd be using GitHub API's, this could be a good for getting familiar with GraphQL).

## Proposed timeline

This is pretty rough and off-the-top-of-my-head, but a rough _order of events_ might look something like:
1. **Draft project specification/user stories** I roughly have something in mind, so would be happy to self-assign this.
2. **Design specification** Also happy to put something together in XD/Sketch, it could just be a single view to start
3. **Decide on tech stack** Since most are familiar with React, that seems like a reasonable framework for frontend. Other considerations:
    1. Utility libraries (I'd push for something in the spirit of `lodash/fp`, `partial.lenses` or `ramda` to maintain the functional-inspired approach ðŸ™‚, but it would also be good practice to implement as many utility functions from scratch as possible)
    2. Testing
    3. Styling
    4. Data-fetching
4. **Proof-of-concept** Frontend only
5. **?**
